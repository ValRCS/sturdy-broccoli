    <h1>Javascript functions , DOM event introduction</h1>
    <h2>Javascript functions</h2>
    <p>What is a function?</p>
    <p>Functions are a way to group code together to perform a specific task. They are reusable and can be called as many times as needed.</p>

    <p>Function declaration</p>
    <p>Functions are declared using the function keyword followed by the name of the function, followed by a set of parentheses. The parentheses can contain parameters, which are variables that are used to store values that are passed into the function. The code block is enclosed in curly braces.</p>
    <p>Function declaration example</p>
    <pre>
        <code>
            function myFunction() {
                // code to be executed
            }
        </code>
    </pre>

    <h2>DOM Events</h2>
    <h3>What is a DOM event?</h3>
    <p>DOM events are actions that happen on the DOM tree. They are triggered by the user or the browser. DOM events are a way to interact with the user and the browser.</p>
    <p>DOM events are a way to interact with the user and the browser.</p>

    <p>DOM stands for Document Object Model. The DOM is a tree-like structure that represents the HTML document. The DOM is used to connect web pages to scripts or programming languages. The DOM is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects. That way, programming languages can connect to the page.</p>
    <p>DOM events are sent to notify code of interesting things that have taken place. Each event is represented by an object which is based on the Event interface, and may have additional custom fields and/or functions used to get additional information about what happened.</p>
