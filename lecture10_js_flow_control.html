    <h1>Lesson 10 - Javascript comparison, logical and conditional operators.</h1>
    <h2>Comparison operators</h2>
    <p>Comparison operators are used in logical statements to determine equality or difference between variables or values.</p>
<p>In javascript the comparison operators are: >,>=, &lt;, &lt;=, ==, ===, !=, !==</p>

<p>For strict comparison use <code>=== , and !==</code></p>

        <h2>Logical operators</h2>
        <p>Logical operators are used to determine the logic between variables or values.</p>
        <p>Logical operators are: &&, ||, !</p>
        <p>Logical AND (&&) - If both operands are true, then the condition becomes true.</p>
        <p>Logical OR (||) - If any of the two operands are non-zero, then the condition becomes true.</p>
        <p>Logical NOT (!) - Used to reverse the logical state of its operand. If a condition is true, then Logical NOT operator will make false.</p>

<h2>Conditional statements</h2>
<p>Conditional statements are used to perform different actions based on different conditions.</p>
<p>Conditional statements are: if, else, else if, switch</p>
<p>if statement - Executes some statements if a specified condition is true.</p>
<p>if...else statement - Executes some statements if a specified condition is true. If the condition is false, another statement is executed.</p>
<p>if...else if...else statement - Executes different codes for more than two conditions.</p>
<p>switch statement - Select one of many code blocks to be executed.</p>
